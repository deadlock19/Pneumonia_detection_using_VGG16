Pneumonia Detection using machine Learning (CNN - vgg16)ðŸ©º

The model has accuracy around 92.5%, which became possible by the use of transfer learning, which allows us to use pre trained model to further optimise the accuracy of existing model.

For this purpose vgg16 library from keras has been used which is based on convolutional Neural network (CNN)

Technologies used-
Python
Flask
Html, css, javascript, bootstrap
Sqlite - sqlalchemy

ML approach-
Transfer learning

Dataset - 
From kaggle, named us chest xrays by Paul moony
that contains around 5800+ xrays images of children of age less then 5 years and females.
